So I work in an environment where people ask a lot of questions that
could have been answered with a few swift key strokes. Instead they hold
for 10 minutes and ask me. Well I came across a great link that someone
sent me while trying to be a smart ass.

I was putting together a .mobi site, and could not figure out why it wasnt working on the shared
hosting account that I was using. I yelled out "why is my index file not
working, im getting a 403!" without really thinking about it and....
..someone sent me this link, http://tinyurl.com/6hgntx I thought it
was pretty funny...
