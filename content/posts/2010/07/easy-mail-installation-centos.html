To install a barebones, default installation of an email server using Postfix
is pretty simple. There are, of course, many other setting that should be
configured in order to secure the server. This is just to get it up and
running and sending mail. 

{% endmark -%}


    sudo yum install postfix


That's about it for the installation, not too bad eh? Now to start the
service


    [david@makewhatis~]$ sudo /etc/init.d/postfix start

Lets test the mail server: 


    [david@makewhatis~]$ mail
    david@makewhatis.com Subject: This is a TEST I pressed enter and now this is
    the body. Now I will press enter and end the body with a period on the next
    line . Cc: 


And that's it! For more detailed instructions on a mail server setup you can
