One thing I used to search for is quick setup instructions for lamp setup on a
server. So Im going to put out one more set of them. If you didnt know
already, lamp is the acronym for linux apache mysql php and is the most common
setup for web servers today. First thing to do if this is a fresh slice/server
is update. 

{% endmark -%}

    sudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade

Now to install Apache, PHP 5.3, MySQL server, all in a few commands. Take not of the
packages that are installed and their dependencies. 

    sudo apt-get install apache2 php5 libapache2-mod-php5 mysql-server libapache2-mod-auth-mysql php5-mysql

This will install everything in sequence, prompting you
at one point for the mysql root password. Create it and that should be about
it. Go ahead and restart apache 

    /etc/init.d/apache2
    restart

... and try to pull up the local page in a browser.
http://localhost/. This will be pulling the files from the /var/www/
directory. Now just start adding files and building some internet.
