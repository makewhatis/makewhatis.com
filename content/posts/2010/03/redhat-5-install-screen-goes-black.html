{% mark excerpt -%}
I recently had to install Redhat 5 and Centos 5 on a few Dell machines. I was
installing these on a Dell Dimension 3100s, and ran into a problem during
install. {% endmark -%} I was installing on over the network with NFS, using a usb
bootloader. As soon as the graphical install started, the screen just went
black. Well, after scouring the internet for a solution, I finally came across
the magic answer. The trick was to enter: 
~~~bash~~~
linux vesa
~~~~~~~~~~
at the boot prompt. Thats it, the installs both went smoothly from there on.
Hopefully this makes it to someone in my same situation.
