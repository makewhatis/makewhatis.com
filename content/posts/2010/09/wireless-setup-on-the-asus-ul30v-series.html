I recently purchased an ASUS UL30V laptop, 13.3" machine. For some oddball
reason the wireless rate defaulted to 1mb/s, which makes for an awful online
experience. How did I find this? Took a minute to figure out what was going on
with this, but looking closely at the output of the iwconfig command showed me
"Bit Rate=54 Mb/s" for the wlan0 device. A quick fix.

Run: 


    iwconfig wlan0 rate 54M [/cc] 

This took care of the problem and cleared my connection. But wait.... when I 
reboot the rate resets to 1Mb/s again. The previous command was not persistent 
through a reboot, therefore I would have to run this command everytime I connect. 
Thank God for simple automation though. I added the following lines to my **/etc/rc.local**
 file. 

    ifconfig wlan0 up iwconfig wlan0 rate 54M 


And wabam! Everytime I boot up this sweet little machine, I connect with normal speeds.
