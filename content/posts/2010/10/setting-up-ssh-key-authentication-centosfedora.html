I have recently had to start dealing with a lot of servers, both at work and
my side business. Logging into them all the time can be a pain, and managing
passwords can be pretty terrible as well. SSH Keys are really convenient for
this scenario.

They are, for the most part, easy to setup. I have run into a few things, especially 
to do with permissions on when implementing them. Here is a simplified breakdown of 
how to set this up on a linux machine (Centos, Fedora, RHEL) 

{% endmark -%}

1\. Create directories on both your local machine, as well as the server. (assuming you are on linux or mac)
    

    mkdir ~/.ssh


2\. Generate your ssh key pair private/public

        
    ssh-keygen -t rsa 

    
3\. Copy your public key to the server and put it into the authorized_keys file. note: this will create the file if it has not been created, as well as append the value if it already exists with data.

    scp id_rsa.pub user@serverip:~/.ssh/
    cat id_rsa.pub >> autorized_keys 

4\. Change permissions on .ssh directory as well as authorized_keys file. 

    chmod 700 ~/.ssh
    chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

Thats it! You should be good to go here. Go ahead and test the login.
The main problem people encounter is when logging in via ssh, it still prompts
for the password. This is usually due to permissions on the .ssh folder as
well as the authorized_keys file.
