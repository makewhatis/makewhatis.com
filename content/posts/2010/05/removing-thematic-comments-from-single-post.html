{% mark excerpt -%}

I was putting together a child theme for a client today, and they required
that their posts exist without the ability to add comments. This is a very
trimmed down template, only used for posting news. After hunting around a bit
I finally found the exact action hook to remove in order to achieve this. 

{% endmark -%}

Add this into your functions.php file inside your child theme: 

~~~php~~~        
function unhook_thematic_functions() {
    remove_action('thematic_comments_template', 'thematic_include_comments', '5');
} add_action('init', 'unhook_thematic_functions');
~~~~~~~~~

This will completely remove the comments box from the post. 
This isn't it though, I also had to remove the option to see comments in the loop, archive list,
etc. So keep that in mind if you are removing comments from the theme
altogether. I used filters for all the other places that I removed comment
related code, so I won't go into that here.
