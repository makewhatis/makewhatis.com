{% mark excerpt -%}

On a new fresh slice at the Rackspace Cloud, you will find that, by default,
there is a firewall blocking everything but port 22, for ssh. When you try to
install and start Apache, nothing happens. The firewall is blocking any
incoming http connections to our server. 

{% endmark -%}

The first thing that you do is setup a rule to allow connections over port 80 
in your IPtables file. 

    ~]# vim /etc/sysconfig/iptables 

Add the following line somewhere above the last REJECT line (I put mine right 
below my port 22 rule.)

    -A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT

Once you do this, all that is left is to restart iptables. 

    ~]# /etc/init.d/iptables restart

...and if you haven't done so already, start apache and set chkconfig on so that it the
service starts on boot.

    ~]# sudo /etc/init.d/httpd start

then... 

    ~]# sudo /sbin/chkconfig httpd on 

Hope that helps somebody.
