I couldn't find a decent python wrapper for the dnsmadeeasy rest api, so I
fired one up. It covers most of the basic operations that they support. The
functions should be laid out clearly, and just in case I added an example.py
file to show usage of most of the functions.

Instantiate the class: 

    dns = dme("API KEY", "SECRET KEY") 

List all of your domains: 

    domains = dns.list_domains() 
    for d in domains:
        print(d)
