We recently started using Sublime Text 2 at Cloudhike to make magic happen,
and I have to say, I'm impressed. One bummer is that there was no package for
Fedora, just a general linux tar file with a compiled binary. This makes
installing, updating, and setting up menu items all a pain with Gnome 3.

I went ahead and built rpms for the latest version 2139, for Fedora 15/16 both
i386/x86_64. These can be found in our repo. We will update these packages as
the next versions come out. To use this repo just download the repo into your
`/etc/yum.repos.d/` directory. Keep in mind this repo is only for  Fedora 15/16
w/ Gnome3. 

    sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/sublime2.repo http://repo.cloudhike.com/sublime2/fedora/sublime2.repo 

NOTE: Dev repo is disabled by default, to enable edit the .repo file and change 0 to 1
