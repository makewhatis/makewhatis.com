I love new things, especially new software. As soon as F15 hit, I jumped onto
the live cd and was pretty pleased. I installed the alpha as my main OS, with
a mean backup solution of my home dir :) of course. I really enjoy the updates
Gnome as done in the jump from 2 to 3, I just hate how they come with a cost
of gnome-shell crashing frequently. This time I waited until the beta for 16,
since there weren't enough benefits to justify going with the alpha release.

I dont get. I am hoping that Gnome 3.2 will have a lot of the bugs worked out,
as they have had a good amount of time at this point to work on that. So far
there doesn't seem to be too much different, aside from the cool underwater
background image. Most of the changes I am hoping to see in performance of
Gnome 3, as the first release was a bit buggy. Kernel 3.1 is installed by
default, along with Gnome 3.19 (hopefully soon to be 3.2) and Firefox 7.0,
which puts this distro at the bleeding edge of its core components and add-
ons. This may come with the cost of some hardships and crashes, but all worth
it to try out this new version.
