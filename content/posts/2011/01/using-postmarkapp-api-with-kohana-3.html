Postmark gives API access to their service, which rocks. People have been kind
enought to develop libraries to access the API as well. There is a lot of info
out there on different implementations of the API, but none that I could find
specifically for Kohana 3. So I threw together a little post for it. I had to
work with Postmark and Kohana 3 this past week. There is no library for Kohana
3 alone, but there is a nifty one for php. Ill run through an example of how
to implement that library into a Kohana 3 application.

{% endmark -%}

 So first we have to import the library into our application. First create a directory in
called "vendors", so "application/vendors". Create another directory inside
vendors for postmarkapp. Download postmark php library from Github and place
those files in the application/vendors/postmarkapp directory. 


<a href="https://github.com/Znarkus/postmark-php">https://github.com/Znarkus
/postmark-php</a> 
Also, if you haven't signed up with postmark, you will want to do that. <a href="http://postmarkapp.com/">http://postmarkapp.com/</a> 
Now that thats in place, next step is to actually tell Kohana that we are using
that library, and where to find it. In the application/bootstrap.php add this
line above the section that starts with "//-- Configuration and
initialization" 

    //import postmarkapp api
    $path = Kohana::find_file('vendors', 'postmarkapp/Postmark');
    if($path) {
        ini_set('include_path',
        ini_get('include_path') . PATH_SEPARATOR . dirname(dirname($path)));
        require_once 'postmarkapp/Postmark.php';
    }

Awesome, now its ready to start using it. In whatever controller you want to
use it in (I'm going to do it in my controller/main.php file) create a
function to send mail. I am setting up some constants for postmark like From
Name and From Email, as well as including the API key I got from Postmark. 

    private function _email($email)
    {
        
        define('POSTMARKAPP_API_KEY', '########-####-####-####-############');
        define('POSTMARKAPP_MAIL_FROM_NAME', 'Test User');
        define('POSTMARKAPP_MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS', 'no-reply@test.com');
        
        try
        {
            Mail_Postmark::compose()
                    ->addTo($email['email'], $email['name'])
                    ->subject('Congratulations')
                    ->messagePlain('We have received your message!')
                    ->send();
                
        }
        catch(Exception $e )
        {
            echo $e->getMessage();
        
        }
        return TRUE;

    }


 Now you have the function setup that does the heavy lifting for you.
Typically you would call this function to send a confirmation or a submitted
form. Below is a very simplified example. If nothing is posted yet, it loads
the form which is in views/contact/form. If the form has posted, then it
processes the data. Keep in mind I have done very little error handling and
data filtering. Lots of good info on the unofficial wiki about that. <a
href="http://kerkness.ca/wiki/doku.php">http://kerkness.ca/wiki/doku.php</a>


    public function action_index()
    {
        if ($_POST)
        {
            // Logic for form handling, database entry, etc. I'm just covering the email part :-)
            
            $confirmation = $this->_email(array('email' => $_POST['email'], 'name' => $_POST['first_name']));
            return $confirmation;
        }           
        $this->request->response = View::factory('contact/form');
        
    }

 So all together the controller looks like: 

defined('SYSPATH') or die('No direct script access.');
    
    class Controller_Main extends Controller
    {
        public function action_index()
        {
            if ($_POST)
            {
                // Logic for form handling, database entry, etc. I'm just covering the email part :-)
            
                $confirmation = $this->_email(array('email' => $_POST['email'], 'name' => $_POST['first_name']));
                return $confirmation;
            }
        
            $this->request->response = View::factory('contact/form');
        
        }
        private function _email($email)
        {
            
            define('POSTMARKAPP_API_KEY', '########-####-####-####-############');
                define('POSTMARKAPP_MAIL_FROM_NAME', 'Test User');
                define('POSTMARKAPP_MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS', 'no-reply@test.com');
            
            try
            {
                Mail_Postmark::compose()
                        ->addTo($email['email'], $email['name'])
                        ->subject('Congratulations')
                        ->messagePlain('We have received your message!')
                        ->send();
                    
            }
            catch(Exception $e )
            {
                echo $e->getMessage();
            
            }
            return TRUE;
        
        }
    }


Then in your View, located under views/contact/form: 

    echo Form::open('main/index');
    echo Form::label('First Name');
    echo Form::input('first_name');
    echo "<br />";
    echo Form::label('email');
    echo Form::input('email');
    echo "<br />";
    echo Form::label('message');
    echo Form::textarea('message');
    echo "<br />";
    echo Form::submit('name', 'Submit');    
    echo Form::close();

 Hope that helps someone get going on using Postmark with their Kohana 3 application.
