{% mark excerpt %}
So I was recently trying to solve my backup/sync problem that I was running
into with a lot of these backup services. The main two that I was using were
Jungledisk and Dropbox. Dropbox is great for documents, scripts, pdfs, etc
that I wanted to have synced accross my machines. Jungledisk was not such a
great sync tool, and configuring it was kind of a pain. I want a simple backup
of my home directory really, that I can sync with my work computer, laptop,
and home pc. I found this little gem, [http://s3tools.org/s3cmd](http://s3tools.org/s3cmd),
that provides a simple wrapper for rsync, with most of the important options. I was able to
write a simple script that syncs my home directory, excluding a few folders,
to Amazon S3 and back. Here is the simple script that I used to back up my
home directory, excluding Music and Video folders, which can be pretty huge.
{% endmark -%}
Keep in mind I have already installed the s3adm program on my machine which is
currently running Fedora 15 alpha. 

    # Script to backup to amazon s3 with s3cmd

    directories=`find ~/ -maxdepth 1 -type d \( ! -iname ".*" ! -iname "Video" \
             ! -iname "Music" \) | awk -F / '{print $4}'`

    for directory in $directories 
    do
        echo "Syncing the \"$directory\" folder to S3" 
        s3cmd sync -v ~/$directory/ s3://homepc_backups/$directory/
    done

Again, the tool can be found [HERE](http://s3tools.org/s3cmd)
