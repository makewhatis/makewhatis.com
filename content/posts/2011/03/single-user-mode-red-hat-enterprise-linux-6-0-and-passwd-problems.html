I was trying to show my little brother how to root a RHEL6 box in single user
mode today, and ran into a little issue. I booted the machine into init 1, but
was not able to change the password. I could add a user, but could not assign
a password. You could type: 
    
    passwd root 

and the cmd prompt would just appear on the next line, as if the command was just blank. 
Then I remembered SELINUX, my old buddy. Disabled selinux: 

    setenforce 0

and bam! Password updated and life goes on.
