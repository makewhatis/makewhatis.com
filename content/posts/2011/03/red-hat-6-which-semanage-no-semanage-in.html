So I was buckling down for the RHCE today and getting into knee deep into
SELinux, when I ran across a little hurdle. I was trying to use
`semanage` and was not able to find the binary. Everything pointed
back to the `policycoreutils` package, which was already installed.
Turns out you actually have to install `policycoreutils-python` in
order to get the `semanage` binary. I would think it would be a little
less cryptic than that, but whatever.
