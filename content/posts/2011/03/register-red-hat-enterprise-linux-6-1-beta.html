{% mark excerpt %}
I was given a number of subscriptions from Redhat for the 6.1 Beta release.
Tonight was the first time I tried to use one, to setup a learning environment
for my brother here. I did not install this with a desktop, so I did not have
the option of choosing to register from `System->Administration->RHN
Registration`. So naturally I tried to type: 

    rhn_register


This took me to the register utility tui, but did not let me register the system. {% endmark -%} I kept
getting errors about the not having any valid entitlements. So then I actually
read through the entire email and saw that they had included this with the
Beta info, that `rhn_register` will not work. The new command for this in 6.1 is
as follows: 

    subscription-manager register --username myusername --password '*************' 

    subscription-manager subscribe --username myusername --password '*************' 

Personally, I liked `rhn_register`, but whatever. Its all the same I supposed.
