I came across this <a href="http://tumblr.dderek.com/post/526900310/using-
cloudfuse-to-mount-the-rackspace-cloud-files">blog post</a> that explained how
to setup cloudfuse on Debian based systems. Cloudfuse allows you do mount your
Cloud Files container to a mount point on your server. 

This could come in useful for backup, restore, etc. Ill go through how to achieve
 this on Centos/RHEL as its a bit different that Ubuntu/Debian. 
{% endmark -%}
1) Install cloudfuse 
 
    wget http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/5/i386/epel-release-5-4.noarch.rpm 
    sudo rpm -ivh epel-release-5-4.noarch.rpm 
    sudo yum install fuse fuse-devel curl curl-devel gcc git makeÂ libxml2 libxml2-devel 
    git clone git://github.com/redbo/cloudfuse.git 
    cd cloudfuse
    ./configure 
    make 
    sudo make install

2) Setup your auth info for Rackspace Cloud Files. These can be set either as mount
options or in a file named `/root/.cloudfuse`

    username=[RS CF username] 
    api_key=[RSCF api key] 

3) add your user to the fuse group 

    sudo usermod -a -G fuse username 

4) Get the gid for the fuse group and hold onto it, you need it in step 6.

    cat /etc/group | grep fuse

5) Create the mount point for cloudfiles 

    mkdir /media/cloudfiles 

6) Add the following into `/etc/fstab` (remember to replace values as they exist on your server, mount point, gid= ) 

    cloudfuse /media/cloudfiles fuse defaults,gid=101,umask=007,allow_other 0 0

7) Finally run the `mount -a` command to mount the your cloudfiles container. 

    sudo mount -a 

At this point you should be able to navigate into that directory and view all the files that are in your cloudfiles account. Have fun.
