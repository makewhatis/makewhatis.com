To pass the RHCE one of the things that Red Hat wants you to setup is a
caching-only name server. This is actually pretty easy with RHEL 6. Install
the bind package.
{% endmark -%}
    sudo yum install bind

Then start the package and set it up to start on boot. 
 
    sudo /sbin/service
    named start && sudo /sbin/chkconfig named on

You have successfully setup the caching-only name server, for real. Now to get it to
forward queries to a specific name server. For me I just forwarded the queries to my local
nameserver, the router on 192.168.1.1. To do this you edit `named.conf` 

    sudo vim /etc/named.conf

In the options section I added: 

    listen-on port 53 { 127.0.0.1; 192.168.1.101;};

(which is the ip for the bind dns server) 
 
    allow-query { localhost; 192.168.1.0/24;};

(adding the ip block for localhost) 

    forward only; 
    forwarders {192.168.1.1;};

This tells our bind server that I want to forward all dns queries to my router.
I could also, for example, forward all queries to my ISP's nameservers. 
In this case the ip would be `68.2.16.30` (ns1.ph.cox.net). 
    
    forwarders {68.2.16.30;};[/cc] 

Thats all there is to that requirement for the Red Hat Certified Engineer exam.
