Centos is a great Distro for hosting. Its tried and tested, as oppossed to
Fedora and Ubuntu, which, while on the cutting edge, can still have a few
quirks. My biggest problem with Centos is that lack for cutting edge, like the
default PHP that installs with Centos, 5.1. It can be a pain to find 3rd party
repos. Well hopefully thats where you are. Looking for 5.3 on Centos. One of
the most solid repos out there is <a
href="http://iuscommunity.org/">http://iuscommunity.org/</a>. I'll run through
how to get that version of php you want on your server.

This assumes you have no php installed at this point. If you do, back up and remove it. Once you are ready:

You have to add the Epel repo first, so run these two commands as root: 
    
    wget http://dl.iuscommunity.org/pub/ius/stable/Redhat/5/x86_64/epel-release-1-1.ius.el5.noarch.rpm rpm -Uvh epel-release-1-1.ius.el5.noarch.rpm
    # Now lets add the IUS Community Repo 
    wget http://dl.iuscommunity.org/pub/ius/stable/Redhat/5/x86_64/ius-release-1.0-6.ius.el5.noarch.rpm rpm -Uvh ius-release-1.0-6.ius.el5.noarch.rpm

This will add the repos to your /etc/yum.repos.d/ directory. Now to go
into the .repo file and make a few changes. The repo configuration file by
default is configured to hit the mirrorlist. Lets set the base url and make
sure the repo is enabled. First comment out the "mirrorlist=http" line in the
main ius repo, and then make sure "enable=1". The first section of your
ius.repo should look like this: 

    [ius] 
    name=IUS Community Packages for Enterprise Linux 5 - $basearch
    baseurl=http://dl.iuscommunity.org/pub/ius/stable/Redhat/5.5/$basearch
    #mirrorlist=http://dmirr.iuscommunity.org/mirrorlist?repo=ius-el5&arch=$basearch
    failovermethod=priority
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=1
    gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/IUS-COMMUNITY-GPG-KEY

Awesome. Now the was IUS does things, is they name php based on version, so php 5.3 is php53u
and if you wanted 5.2 it would just be php52. An easy way to check, would be
do a yum list: 

    yum list php53u

Or to see all php53u packages: 

    yum list php53u*

Now just yum install the packages you need and you'll be running on a fresh version of php 5.3.
