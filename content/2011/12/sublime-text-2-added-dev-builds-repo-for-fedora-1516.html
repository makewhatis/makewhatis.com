{% mark excerpt %}
Sublime Text 2 is constantly getting updates for the dev builds, and not so
much on the stable. For those of you who like to live on the bleeding edge, I
added a "sublime2-dev" repo. This will contain all of the builds as they are
released, which seems to be every few days. http://www.sublimetext.com/dev
Also added a symlink "/usr/bin/sublime" to make calling files from the command
line easier.

To use the new repo just redownload the new repo file and yum
upgrade: 

    wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/sublime2.repo http://repo.cloudhike.com/sublime2/fedora/sublime2.repo
