If you don't know how to use find, or have never experienced its goodness,
then you are missing out. I avoided crazy commands like this when I first
started making the switch from windows to linux because they were sort of
intimidating. When you get down to it, its actually pretty straightforward.
Base command is just "find" which makes sense. After that there is a whole
world of switches (options) to use, but I will only brush on a few of them.
Here is an example that is used all the time. You want to find a file in your
home directory. We do this in the format "find [PATH] [OPTIONS] [FILENAME]"
{% endmark -%}

    find /home/user/ -type f -name ".bashrc"

This will initiate a search of the /home/user/ directory looking for the .bashrc file.
To find a file, case insensitive, created by a user in /home/. 

    find /home/ -iname 'gopher.txt' 

This will return Gopher.txt and gopher.txt, should they both exist. Lets say you want
to find all files that are less than 1 day old. Maybe someone changed a file in
your website and you need to find out which one to fix it.

    find /var/www/ -type f -mtime -1

Try it out. If any files have been modified less than 24 hours ago, they will show up. 
You could also reverse that and do +1 to find all files that have been modified over 24 ago.

I will add more to this post, just short on time at the moment.
