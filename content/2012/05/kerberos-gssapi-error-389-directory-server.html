Was playing with 389 Directory Server, preparing for my upcoming exam and ran into a weird issue. I was able to authenticate via ssh to my client server, against the 389 DS, via Kerberos just fine. But when I ran a ldapsearch or any other query with "-Y GSSAPI", it bombed out with this error:

    $ ldapsearch -p 389 -h example.com -Y GSSAPI
    SASL/GSSAPI authentication started
    ldap_sasl_interactive_bind_s: Invalid credentials (49)
        additional info: SASL(-1): generic failure: GSSAPI Error: Unspecified GSS failure.  Minor code may provide more information (Permission denied)

This was the only thing bombing out, because I could auth just fine, I could kinit and get tickets, and really anything else I tried worked, besides this. 

After confirming that Kerberos was working, Directory Server was working, and the only thing now working was ldap querys via Kerberos to that particular server, I knew it was the way that DS was using Kerberos. It started up just fine as well.

Turns out I was missing the export statement in the sysconfig file for dirsrv on the Directory Server itself. I had the `KRB5_KTNAME=FILE:/etc/ldap.keytab; ` just not `KRB5_KTNAME=FILE:/etc/ldap.keytab; export KRB5_KTNAME`.

So if you are getting a weird auth error, double check that the KRB environmental variables are setup correctly.
