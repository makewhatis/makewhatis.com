I'm studying for the RHCA exam 423, and one of my tasks is to setup TLS for Directory Server. I know RedHat like to follow standards, and am guessing that I will have to use a CA signed cert when setting this up. So in the name of doing things right, I'm going to setup a little CA that I can work with.

## Setting up OpenSSL as a Certificate Authority (Quick and Dirty)

I set this CA up on Fedora 16, the official AMI on EC2.

Right out of the box OpenSSL is ready to act as a CA, so this was not that crazy. 

### The Configuration

First I looked to see what the default CA configuration was in the /etc/pki/tls/openssl.cnf.

	[ CA_default ]
	dir             = /etc/pki/CA           # Where everything is kept
	certs           = $dir/certs            # Where the issued certs are kept
	crl_dir         = $dir/crl              # Where the issued crl are kept
	database        = $dir/index.txt        # database index file.
	#unique_subject = no                    # Set to 'no' to allow creation of
	new_certs_dir   = $dir/newcerts         # default place for new certs.
	certificate     = $dir/cacert.pem       # The CA certificate
	serial          = $dir/serial           # The current serial number
	crlnumber       = $dir/crlnumber        # the current crl number
										    # must be commented out to leave a V1 CRL
	crl             = $dir/crl.pem          # The current CRL
	private_key     = $dir/private/cakey.pem# The private key
	RANDFILE        = $dir/private/.rand    # private random number file

	x509_extensions = usr_cert              # The extentions to add to the cert

	# Comment out the following two lines for the "traditional"
	# (and highly broken) format.
	name_opt        = ca_default            # Subject Name options
	cert_opt        = ca_default            # Certificate field options

Really what I was concerned with was the "dir" attribute, and that is set for /etc/pki/CA, which is fine for me since this is just for studying. 

	[root@ca ~]# ls /etc/pki/CA/
	certs  crl  newcerts  private

### Create the CA Certs

First real step to creating a little CA is to create the CA key/cert pair that will be doing the signing. 

	[root@ca ~]# cd /etc/pki/CA/
	[root@ca CA]# openssl req -new -x509 -extensions v3_ca -keyout  private/CA.key -out CA.crt -days 365 -config ../tls/openssl.cnf
	Generating a 2048 bit RSA private key
	......................................................................................................+++
	.........+++
	writing new private key to 'private/CA.key'
	Enter PEM pass phrase:
	Verifying - Enter PEM pass phrase:
	-----
	You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
	into your certificate request.
	What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
	There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
	For some fields there will be a default value,
	If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
	-----
	Country Name (2 letter code) [XX]:US
	State or Province Name (full name) []:Arizona
	Locality Name (eg, city) [Default City]:Phoenix
	Organization Name (eg, company) [Default Company Ltd]:Makewhatis Corp
	Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:PKI
	Common Name (eg, your name or your server's hostname) []:Makewhatis    
	Email Address []:david@makewhatis.com

### Some Security

Lets make sure that nobody can read that key but root while we are at it, even though this is just for practice. 

	[root@ca CA]# chmod 400 /etc/pki/CA/private/CA.key 

Also make sure the private key dir is only accessible by root

	[root@ca CA]# ls -l /etc/pki/CA/
	total 16
	drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 4096 Apr  7 20:30 certs
	drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 4096 Jan 19 11:37 crl
	drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 4096 Jan 19 11:37 newcerts
	drwx------. 2 root root 4096 Apr  7 20:25 private

This is looking good. Now we can actually do some signing!

### Signing Certs

#### Client generates their key

	[root@ca ~]# openssl genrsa 1024 > www.example.com.key
	Generating RSA private key, 1024 bit long modulus
	................................++++++
	........++++++
	e is 65537 (0x10001)

#### Then they generate their CSR (Certificate Signing Request)

	[root@ca ~]# openssl req -new -key www.example.com.key -out www.example.com.csr
	You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
	into your certificate request.
	What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
	There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
	For some fields there will be a default value,
	If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
	-----
	Country Name (2 letter code) [XX]:US
	State or Province Name (full name) []:Imagination Land
	Locality Name (eg, city) [Default City]:Up Top
	Organization Name (eg, company) [Default Company Ltd]:Make it So LLC
	Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:We dont
	Common Name (eg, your name or your server's hostname) []:www.example.com
	Email Address []:me@myownmind.ee

	Please enter the following 'extra' attributes
	to be sent with your certificate request
	A challenge password []:
	An optional company name []:

#### Make their certificate

Once the client has generated their CSR and sent it to us, we can actually sign a .crt file for them. 

	[root@ca ~]# openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in www.example.com.csr -CA /etc/pki/CA/certs/CA.crt -CAkey /etc/pki/CA/private/CA.key -CAcreateserial -out www.example.com.crt
	Signature ok
	subject=/C=US/ST=Imagination Land/L=Up Top/O=Make it So LLC/OU=We dont/CN=www.example.com/emailAddress=me@myownmind.ee
	Getting CA Private Key
	Enter pass phrase for /etc/pki/CA/private/CA.key:

Now we have the certificate, and we can test it to make sure its what we were looking to get out of this.

	[root@ca ~]# ls
	www.example.com.crt  www.example.com.csr

	[root@ca ~]# openssl x509 -in www.example.com.crt -text -noout

In order to use this without getting a warning, you will have to import the CA.crt file into the application you are using, but other than that, the CA is setup.
