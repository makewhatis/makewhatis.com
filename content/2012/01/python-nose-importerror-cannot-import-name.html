Was running tests this week with Jenkins and Nose on a number of tests in my
"tests" directory. For some reason one of my test files kept getting passed up
when I ran nosetests on the entire directory. When consulting the google, I
only found one other complaint of this, on a google code issue now ported over
to github issues. https://github.com/nose-devs/nose/issues/108 While this
doesnt tell how to deal with it, or give any resolution whatsoever, it lets me
know that this is something that has yet to be resolved.{% endmark -%} I got around it by
just running a for loop in the shell area in the Jenkins job:
	
    for file in `ls | grep '^test.*.py$'`; do 
        nosetests -v --with-xunit --xunit-file=$file.xml $file;
    done

Had to name the xml files dynamically or they get overwritten, but that shouldn't
 matter as long as you just glob the target *.xml in the config section of the Jenkins job.
