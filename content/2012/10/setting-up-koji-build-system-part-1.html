I recently setup an instance of the Koji Build System for work, to assist us with building RPMS in a sane, managed way. This was a bit of an experience, as the documentation didn't actually explain the setup completely in the guide. It was more like mining the Fedora Wiki for bits and pieces of how this beast works. 

Koji is downright amazing though. Once setup and running its does exactly what it is supposed to, and well. Its a rpm building powerhouse.
