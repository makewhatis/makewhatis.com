I've been eyeing the static site generators for some time now, and just haven't gotten myself to site down and learn one yet. First one that caught my eye was [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), but being as that was in ruby it didn't seem like too much fun to hack on (not hating on ruby, just more about python these days). [Hyde](https://github.com/hyde/hyde) is a pure python generator that has had some heavy development over the past year. It went from a DJango based app, to one that was coded from the ground up. 

I'll admit, it took a minute to wrap my head around the Jinga2 templating and how everything tied into Hydes structure. Documentation is lacking, but the code isn't too crazy to figure out.

Now that I spent a good weekend disecting the code, I am pretty happy with it overall. I switched from the Thematic-based wordpress theme Ninja, to the Skeleton theme, wrapped around hyde. 

Maybe its the fact that I get to setup automatic deployments with Jenkins upon commit that makes me like this better, or perhaps the fact that there is no database whatsoever to deal with. Either way I am enjoying this system so far. 

As far as comments, the only options were really a hosted solution like Disqus or Intense Debate. I was going to dump them altogether to increase load time :-P but they really are a good way to get responses and suggestions from people, as well as for others to reach out with any questions. 

If you dig the idea of pure html being compiled each time you update your blog, and you like python way more than ruby, then you should probably check out [Hyde](https://github.com/hyde/hyde).
