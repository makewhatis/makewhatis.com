I've decided to take the first of 5 exams to get my [Red Hat Certified Architect Certification](http://www.redhat.com/training/certifications/rhca/). The first exam I am going for is the EX423, [Red Hat Enterprise Directory Services and Authentication Expertise Exam](http://www.redhat.com/training/courses/ex423/), which focuses a lot on LDAP.

According to the [exam objectives](http://www.redhat.com/certification/ex423/prep_guide/) they will be focusing primarily on implementing authentication with Red Hat Directory Server, which is an add-on that is available with a RHEL subscription. Fortunately, like the OS itself, there is an open source version that ships with Fedora, 389 Directory Server.

I've never actually had to set this up before, most companies already have this setup when you join. At the company I am with now, there is a whole department that does nothing but ldap/user administration, so we don't get to touch the internals at all.

*Setup Fedora 16*

I am using VirtualBox, and just installing F16 fresh. Nothing special, just installing a base server install. Not going into the actual setup here, if you are reading this I assume you can install Fedora, being engineers and all ;-)

*Install 389-ds and dependencies*

Once my installation is complete, and my box is all updated, I installed the 389-ds package
	
	~# yum install 389-ds

*Create non-privileged user*

Its recommended to create a seperate user for this, rather than use nobody, since nothing should really be owned by nobody.

 	~# useradd -s /sbin/nologin ldapuser


*Run setup script*

Once thats all ready to go, I had to run the setup script:

    ~# setup-ds-admin.pl

which consited of answering a number of questions about setup, most of which I left default. I did modify the hostname, using an actual domain name I configured for this setup. Seems like it was doing a dns lookup as part of the setup (I could be wrong).

Note: One major difference is that 389-ds has some small changes in the way it works, since its moved to systemd and out of chkconfig. So to start, its no longer:

	~# service dirsrv start

instead its:

	~# systemctl start dirsrv.target

And to configure start at boot use systemctl instead of chkconfig:

	~# systemctl enable dirsrv.target

More to come... I'm done for today :-)
