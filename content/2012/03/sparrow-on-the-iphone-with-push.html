 So I was in Vegas a few weeks ago, and really wanted to tether via my iPhone, but quickly found out that's a no go. I saw an app out there, Tether, that would let me do this, but Apple pulled from the store the day it was released. 

 So, I jailbroke my phone. 

 Sparrow was released a few days ago. Unfortunately this came without push because Apple rejected that version. Something about duplicating native features. How lame. 

 A super nice developer out there, Kim Streich, has released Sparrow Push, which is available to jailbroken phones in the Cydia store. Yay!

 Now I have this section in my settings that gives me push. 

 ![iphone push]({{ media_url('post-images/app-iphone-push.jpg') }})
