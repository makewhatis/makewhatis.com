We were looking for a solution for a new site that we are developing and ran
across <a href="http://www.mosso.com">mosso</a> on some random site. At the
time we were on a dedicated solution at <a
href="http://www.godaddy.com">godaddy</a> and were paying a decent amount for
that.

The cloud looked intriguing and the fact that it was hosted by rackspace
made it even more appealing. We made the move a month back and I can say that
I do see an improvement in performance. Our sites definitely load faster and
run better. I miss a lot of the control we had on Server 2008, but so far its
not so bad. I feel a bit safer with all of our sites running on the cloud as
opposed to our server. Before, if something happened to that dedicated server,
then we were out of luck for at least 8 hours, which is common response time
for many dedicated hosts. There have been a few limitations that I have run
into as well. I mean with the good always comes some bad right? 1. I tried to
load up a site the other day which runs on Umbraco as its platform, only to
find out that we are on a medium trust host. 2. I asked about the connection
limits on the SQL server databases, wondering if that were also a limitation
that we may face in the future. I really did not get an answer from them. They
rep who I spoke acknowledged that there were limitations but did not know the
numbers. Aside from those two hiccups I have to say that its been a pleasure
moving over to their cloud hosting. I am just waiting for Mosso to come out
with the Windows Server 2008 Cloud Servers, which they said are currently in
development. I like the company so far, and the support is always there and
ready to help which is always a plus. I would recommend them for sure.
