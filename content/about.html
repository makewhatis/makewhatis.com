My name is David Johansen. This is where I post things that I find useful. 

This site was built [Hyde](https://github.com/hyde/hyde), a static site generator made with Python, which is just amazing. 

Here is my [github page](https://github.com/makewhatis) where I have a few things.

And <a href="http://resume.makewhatis.com/">my resume</a>, just to have it out there ;-)
