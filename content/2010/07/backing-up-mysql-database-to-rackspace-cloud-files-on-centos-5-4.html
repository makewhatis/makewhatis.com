I just got done setting up automatic backups to Rackspace Cloud files for a
MySQL db running on Centos 5.4. I followed this 
[guide](http://blog.jtclark.ca/2010/02/backup-mysql-to-rackspace-cloud-files-
with-duplicity/ "Guide") here which is directed at Ubuntu 9.10 users, but
worked just fine on Centos. Only change I really had to make was installing
via yum, as opposed to apt-get.

It went pretty smoothly, and my db is now being backed up once every hour, 
on the hour to my cloud files container. Sweet stuff ;-) I won't regurgitate 
the code, so just visit this URL to get educated:

(just remember to pick up the latest version of python-cloudfiles, because the
link in the article is a couple releases behind).
