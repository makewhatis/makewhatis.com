After successfully setting up Magento on Centos 5.4, and installing the theme
we developed for our client, I was still running into a problem with the
contact form. Every time I submitted a contact request, I received this
generic error: **Unable to submit your request. Please, try again
later**
{% endmark -%}
First off, I had to check my server and make sure that *postfix* was 
running and installed correctly. I examined `/etc/postfix/main.cf`
to make sure my settings were correct from my installation. Since all the settings 
were correct, and I was able to send a mail from the command line, I then looked 
at my php configuration to make sure the mail() function was working correctly. 
In order to test the mail function I uploaded a simple mail script: 

    mail('admin@domain.com', 'Test email using PHP', 'This is a test email
    message', 'From:admin@domain.com','admin@domain.com');

This script worked fine and mail was sent out successfully to me. This narrowed
it down to an issue with Magento itself, and most likely the base theme that we had
developed it from. A little research on the old Google, and I ran across this
article at [screencastworld.com](http://screencastworld.com/2010/03/articles/magento-
commerce-1-4-how-to-fix-unable-to-submit-your-request-please-try-again-
later%E2%80%99-on-the-contact-us-form#xE2;-on-the-contact-us-
form) The Magento form was failing due to validation
errors from `/app/code/core/Mage/Contacts/controllers/IndexController.php`
Magento was trying to validate the "hideit" field, which did not exist in our
form. 

    if (Zend_Validate::is(trim($post['hideit']), 'NotEmpty'))
    { $error = true; } 


So I just had to go into my form and add this line right above the submit button: 


    <input type="text" style="display: none ! important;" value="" id="hideit" name="hideit">

That's it, the form now works fine with that hidden field added. Weird problem
and a bit of a headache to solve, but hopefully you ran across this article
before it drove you too crazy.
