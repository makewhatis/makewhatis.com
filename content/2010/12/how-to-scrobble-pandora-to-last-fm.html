So I have been loving my Pandora membership lately, now that I'm in a position
at work where I can just listen. One thing that always bugged me was the
rivalry between Pandora and Last.fm, because I love to listen to music on
Pandora while keeping track of music on Last.fm. 
There is the plugin for Firefox, [LastFMFirefox Extension](http://code.yerblog.com/lastfm/)
which is cool, but doesn't seem to work on Linux. I used to use this back when
I still used windows and it worked great.

Now I primarily use Ubuntu, and well that doesnt seem to work. Also, not really 
a fan of firefox anymore, I use Chrome as it seems to handle my obnoxious habits 
(keeping 25+ tabs open) much better. So besides Pandora allowing Last.fm scrobbling,
there wasn't much else I could find. Then I ran across [http://www.lastpandora.com/](http://www.lastpandora.com/) which
accomplishes just this. It loads Pandora into a frame in the browser, and
sends the listened tracks to last.fm as they are played. Pretty nice.
Hopefully one day Pandora One subscribers will be able to just do this in the
settings area, but for now this will do.
