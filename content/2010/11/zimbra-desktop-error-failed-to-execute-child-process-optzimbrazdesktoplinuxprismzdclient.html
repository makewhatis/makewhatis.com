Just installed zimbra to use with our zimbra mail here at work on linux Mint 10. Got this error as soon as I tried to launch. 

    There was an error launching the application Details: Failed to execute child process 
    "/opt/zimbra/zdesktop/linux/prism/zdclient" (no such file or directory) 

A little scouring of the internet showed that this package is needed "ia32-libs". A quick sudo apt-get ia32-libs and I was up and running.
