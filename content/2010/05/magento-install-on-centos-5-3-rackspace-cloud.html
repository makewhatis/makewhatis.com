I recently took on the job of setting up a Magento install on Centos 5.3. I
had originally played around with Ubuntu 9.1 for the job because I wanted the
latest and greatest package support. After reading around and installing on
both platforms, I decided to go with Centos for stability and security. Being
more comfortable with the RedHat platform it worked out better for me. Like
every other install I have jumped into, there was no "one" guide that covered
everything. I am making my own guide, a detailed step by step process of how I
installed Magento 1.4.0.1 on my newly provisioned Rackspace Cloud Server
running CentOS 5.3 64bit.

### Update Server

First thing after the provision was to update the OS with all the latest packages: 

    yum update


_install vim-enhanced_

I enjoy using vim the most, as far as console text editors. So optionally install this package as it is not included in the
default install here. 


    yum install vim-enhanced.x86_64


### Install Apache/Zend Server/php 5.3/Mysql 5.1

I found the easiest way to get all the dependencies for Magento was to just run Zend Server on top of
Apache. So next I added the Zend Repo: 

    
    vim /etc/yum.repos.d/zend.repo
    

    [Zend] name=Zend Server
    baseurl=http://repos.zend.com/zend-server/rpm/$basearch enabled=1 gpgcheck=0
    [Zend_noarch] name=Zend Server - noarch baseurl=http://repos.zend.com/zend-
    server/rpm/noarch enabled=1 gpgcheck=0 
    

Next I installed Zend Server with PHP 5.3 

    
    yum install zend-server-ce-php-5.3
    

The install of CentOS that I started with came with a locked down firewall, so I had to
add a firewall exception to the /etc/sysconfig/iptables 

    
    vim /etc/sysconfig/iptables
    

Add the following rule about the REJECT rules:

    
    -A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT 
    
Save the file and restart IPTables 

    
    /etc/init.d/iptables restart 
    

In order to get MySQL 5.1 on CentOS I had to enable the Remi Repo, since there is no 
official CentOS release at this time. In order to accomplish this I used the following commands: 

    
    wget http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/epel/5/i386/epel-release-5-3.noarch.rpm
    wget http://rpms.famillecollet.com/el5.i386/remi-release-5-7.el5.remi.noarch.rpm 
    rpm -Uvh remi-release-5\*.rpm epel-release-5\*.rpm 
    

Those commands added a remi.repo file to my
/etc/yum.repos.d/ folder. This will allow install the latest version of MySQL
via yum. 


    yum --enablerepo=remi install mysql-5.1.46-1.el5.remi mysql-server-5.1.46-1.el5.remi 
    yum --enablerepo=remi install php-mysql php-pdo 


### Install Magento
 
Now that the server is ready to run Magento, we can download and install. 

There are two ways to do this, with the downloader or manually with the full package. I
used the full package and just uploaded the folder to my server. Once I had the files 
on my server and extracted into the appropriate directory, I ran the chgrp command to give
ownership to the apache group. 


    chgrp apache app
    chgrp apache downloader
    chgrp apache js
    chgrp apache lib
    chgrp apache media
    chgrp apache pkginfo
    chgrp apache report
    chgrp apache skin
    chgrp apache var 


And even with the awful reputation chmod 777 has, magento requires that we chmod
certain directories in order for it to run the install. 


    chmod 777 /app/etc 
    chmod 777 /media/downloader
    chmod 777 /media/import
    chmod 777 /var 


Now we can finally run the install by simply going to the our
servers main url. There are so many other things that can be configured and
setup in order to optimize a server running Magento, but this was just a brief
walkthrough of a basic setup. Hope this helps somebody.
