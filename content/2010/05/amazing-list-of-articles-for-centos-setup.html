I was cruising around the internet today looking for an answer and i ran
across the Slicehost guides. I remember a while back using those for my first
Debian Lenny setup. I checked to see what kind of resources they had for
CentOS, since I pretty much only work with Red Hat these days. For someone
just starting out this series of articles lay out the basics of getting setup
like no other site out there.

Here is the link to the whole page
of articles related to CentOS setup on a slice: [CentOS Setup Guides](http://articles.slicehost.com/tags/centos). If
you are looking for a good place to get your feet wet, then I would recommend
[Rackspace](http://www.rackspacecloud.com/905-0-3-13.html "On-Demand Linux and Windows Servers on the Cloud"). I can
create a virtual machine, use it for a few hours for testing, and end up paying less
than a dollar.
