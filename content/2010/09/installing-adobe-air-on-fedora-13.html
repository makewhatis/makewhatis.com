I sat down to setup a new box with FC 13 on it tonight. Everything went really
smooth until I wanted to install Adobe Air applications on there. I kept
getting this big fat error: 

    [tom@tomhost Downloads]$ ./AdobeAIRInstaller.bin 
    (setup:2351): Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to locate theme engine in module_path: "clearlooks", 
    (setup:2351): Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to locate theme engine in module_path: "clearlooks",

I finally found a series of guides that got me through it. The first one was this site, which got 
me most of the way. 

[http://www.if-not-true-then-false.com/2010/install-adobe-air-1-5-and-2-on-fedora-centos-and-red-hat-rhel/](http://www.if-not-true-then-false.com/2010/install-adobe-air-1-5-and-2-on-fedora-centos-and-red-hat-rhel/)


Next one got me the rest of the way:
[http://dnmouse.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=8](http://dnmouse.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=8)

After installing all of those dependencies I was able to run the AdobeAir executable and install.
