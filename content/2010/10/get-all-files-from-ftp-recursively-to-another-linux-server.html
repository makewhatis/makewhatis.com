I just had to move about 50 sites off of rackspace cloud sites, onto a
dedicated server. Thats a lot of files, about 48000 actually. There is no ssh
access, only ftp with that service, so I had to get all of the files that way.
I am not a fan of normal ftp on the command line, and didnt really know how to
do it.

I ran across this on serverfault.com: 

[http://serverfault.com/questions/25199/using-wget-to-recursively-download-whole-ftp-directories](http://serverfault.com/questions/25199/)

which gave such a simple, but effective answer. 

    wget -m ftp://username:password@ip.of.old.host 

``Keep in mind, this does not move all of your hidden files... i.e. .htaccess``
